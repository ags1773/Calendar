# Calender
Display the calender for the chosen month and year.

Important issues:
- display appropriate calender for October 1582 
- edit stylesheet to adjust viewport for varying screen sizes
- remove all "viaiblity: hidden" and instead add "display: none". Pay special attention to "h2" as it isn't listening to applied css 
- remove "refresh" button and add logic to automatically reset the calender when a new month and year is selected
- improve the logic which checks for leap year. Use ternary operator if possible and use lesser numbeer of variables

Not so iportant issues / new functionalities:
- make the text colour for all sundays red
- add logic to obtain system date and highlight it in calender
